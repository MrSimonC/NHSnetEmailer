# NHS.net Emailer
This is a Python program which allows you to directly email out nhs.net emails from python.

Nhs.net's locally stored email is only allowed on devices which are encrypted. If you are using a desktop PC where the encryption license cannot be afforded, this program will allow you to emulate logging into the NHS.net website and sending an email directly through python.
